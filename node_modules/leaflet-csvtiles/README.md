leaflet-csvtiles is a leaflet plugin that load points from tiled csv files, using the amazing [PapaParse](http://papaparse.com/) library.

** This plugin was developed mainly for application with Simple CRS, with different CRS the tiles will always be uniformly spaced in lat and lng (so not uniformly spaced in the map see the demo for the problem visualization)**

- ``tileSize`` Number or Number[] size of one tile (same unit as ``size``).
- ``scale`` Number or Number[], scale to apply to the points coordinates.
- ``bounds`` LatLngBounds, (in map coordinates) if  provided the ``scale`` parameter will be computed to fit the points into the given ``bounds``.
- ``localRS `` boolean, if points are given in local (tile) coordinates in each tile.
- ``origin`` offset of the points coordinates
- ``offset`` offset of the tile indexes.
- ``minZoom``
